#### I am a professional problem solver. 

Currently I am working as Senior Software Engineer at Staples. I am always looking to learn new and challenging ways to improve my software development skills, I spend a lot of my free time working on coding, hacking microcontrollers, and playing music.

At Staples I am involved in maintaining and improving the enterprise monitoring solutions. We are currently in the midst of developing a new enterprise wide application monitoring system using open source technologies!

For fun I am doing a deep dive into the world of Go and the world of open source software, I am looking to contribute back the community soon.
